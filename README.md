Infobar
==========

Modular informer for i3bar (forked from Like-all/infobar)

This informer can show you any useful messages via plugins. The plugins can be written in **any programming language**: you just need to write to stdout a json-formatted string.

Example:
```
{"name":"weather","full_text":"Moscow: â˜½ 17","color":"#FFCC00","separator":false},
```

There are four items: a plugin name, a plugin text, and a plugin color. Also, after the object you need to write a trailing comma.

Installation
------------

Just clone the repo to *~/.infobar*, then add these lines into *~/.i3/config*:

```
bar {
	position top
	status_command ~/.infobar/infobar
}
```

Infobar takes each plugin name from *~/.infobar/plugins/.order*. If you want to add your own plugin, you just need to put your plugin executable into *~/.infobar/plugins* and add a line with plugin name into *~/.infobar/plugins/.order*. Infobar executes its plugins in a sequental order.
